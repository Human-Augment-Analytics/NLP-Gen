    A case will contain many more documents than are uploaded to the Clearinghouse. We generally add documents that provide additional information that help someone understand what is going on in the case, such as complaints, opinions, orders, and settlement agreements. We also add documents that we find particularly interesting, such as letters between lawyers about how to litigate the case. Particularly interesting documents that apply more broadly, such as memoranda explaining a complex litigation strategy involving multiple cases, are uploaded as resources (see [Resource](https://api.clearinghouse.net/api-reference/objects/resource)).

Most of the document types are specific kinds of court filings (e.g. \"Complaint\"), while others are more general (e.g. \"Correspondence\"). ***Complaint*** - A document that contains the facts underlying the lawsuit, the plaintiff's legal claims, and what the plaintiff would like the court to do. A complaint often starts a case. ***Opinion/Order*** - A document where a judge or court make a decision in a case and (sometimes) explain their reasoning. These can be very short or very long, depending on the amount of legal reasoning. ***Pleading/Motion/Brief*** - This is a catch-all category for documents filed by lawyers in court. ***Monitor/Expert/Receiver Report*** - Monitors, experts, and receivers are all people with special expertise (e.g. doctors) who give the court their professional opinion. Often they create written reports on their findings. ***Settlement*** - An agreement between the parties of the lawsuit to end the case. It might include a promise to pay money or to change actions. ***Docket*** - A court's record of everything that happened in a case, usually organized by date. ***Correspondence*** - A letter NOT filed in court. ***Declaration/Affidavit*** - A legal document where somebody swears that facts are true, under penalty of perjury. ***Discovery/FOIA Material*** - Discovery: the evidence in a case, turned over as part of a lawsuit. FOIA Material: government documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (or similar) request. ***FOIA Request*** - A request for government documents under the Freedom of Information Act. ***Internal Memorandum*** - A memorandum or correspondence inside of an organization. ***Legislative Report*** - A report by a legislature. ***Magistrate Report/Recommendation*** - In the federal court system, magistrates are lower level judges who don't have the full powers of a federal judge. Sometimes they will resolve a legal question by writing a report and recommendation to a full federal judge, who can approve or reject it. These usually look a lot like opinions. ***Statute/Ordinance/Regulation*** - A rule or law created by a legislature or state or federal agency. ***Executive Order*** - A rule or order created by the president, a governor, or someone else in charge of a governmental entity, like a city or county. ***Transcripts*** - A verbatim written record of a hearing or trial in court. These are in dialog format, like a screenplay. ***Justification Memo*** - An internal memo by a DOJ attorney explaining why an entity should be investigated. This document type is just for U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division cases. ***Notice Letter*** - A public letter from the DOJ to an entity letting them know they are the subject of an investigation. This document type is just for U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division cases. ***Findings Memo*** - A public memo from the DOJ explaining the findings of an investigation. This document type is just for U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division cases. ")

Is the order on consent (the parties agreed to it) or was it litigated (the parties didn't agree and the court had to decide)? Order type only matters for documents created by judges and settlements approved by judges. That means that for most document types, this value is null. ***null*** - The document is not a court order. ***Non-Decree*** - A court order that does not tell somebody outside the lawsuit to do something. ***Litigated Decree*** - A court order that tells somebody outside the lawsuit to do something, where the parties didn't agree on the outcome. ***Consent Decree*** - A court order that tells somebody outside the lawsuit to do something, where the parties agreed on the outcome.
