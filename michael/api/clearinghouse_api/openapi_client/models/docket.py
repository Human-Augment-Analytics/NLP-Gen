    A docket lists, in chronological order, every document filed with the court in a case; this also serves as a timeline of events. A docket also includes the judge(s), parties, and lawyers in a case. A docket number is the individual identifier that a court gives to a case. (Some courts use different terms, but the idea is the same.) Docket numbers usually include some or all of the following information, though it can appear in different orders or formats: - The year the case was filed - The type of case (civil, criminal, etc.) - A unique serial number for the case - Information on which courthouse or jurisdiction it was filed in We collect complete docket numbers as they appear on case documents. We also collect the information it contains (year, case type, etc.) in separate fields. Our system is designed around the federal courts' docketing conventions. The fields on our website correspond to the normal format for federal court docket number: 1:18-cv-528 (office:year-case type-filing number).
